# 🚀 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using LangChain

In this repository, I have implemented **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using the **LangChain** framework. RAG combines the power of **retrieval-based methods** with **generation-based models** to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that require retrieving and generating information from a knowledge base.

## 🔑 What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique where a model leverages external information (such as documents, knowledge bases, or databases) to improve its ability to generate relevant and contextually accurate responses. The model uses a **retriever** to gather relevant information from external sources and then **augments** the generative model's output with this information.

RAG combines two key components:
1. **Retriever** 🔍: A system that searches a knowledge base or document collection to find relevant data.
2. **Generator** 📝: A large language model (LLM) like GPT that generates human-like responses based on the retrieved data.

This process allows the model to generate more informed and accurate text compared to relying solely on the model's pre-existing knowledge.

## ⚙️ How It Works in LangChain

In LangChain, **RAG** can be implemented using the following steps:
1. **Embedding**: Text documents or knowledge sources are embedded into vector representations.
2. **Retriever**: The retriever is responsible for searching the knowledge base using vector similarity to find the most relevant documents.
3. **Generation**: Once relevant documents are retrieved, they are passed to a generative model (like GPT) to augment the model's response with this information.

LangChain simplifies the integration of these components by providing tools to:
- Create embeddings from text.
- Set up retrieval systems to find relevant data.
- Generate augmented text based on both the input query and the retrieved data.

## 🧑‍💻 Key Components in This Repository

1. **Retriever** 🔍:
   - The retriever is responsible for searching a knowledge base or document collection to find relevant data. It uses techniques such as **vector embeddings** and **similarity search** to retrieve the best matches.

2. **Generator** 📝:
   - The generative model (such as GPT) is responsible for producing human-like responses. The retrieved documents are fed into the model to guide the response generation process.

3. **LangChain Integration** 🔗:
   - LangChain integrates the retrieval and generation steps seamlessly, using vector databases and language models together. LangChain’s API provides a simple interface to set up and configure RAG pipelines.

## 🚀 Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   Navigate to the repository directory and install the required packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the example notebook**:
   You can run the **RAG** example notebook to see the process in action:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook rag_example.ipynb
   ```

4. **Configure the retriever and generator**:
   Set up your retriever (for example, using **FAISS** or **Chroma**) and connect it to your language model generator.

## 📋 Requirements

The following libraries are required:
- `langchain` 🌐
- `openai` 💬
- `faiss-cpu` or `chromadb` for retrievers 🔍
- `numpy` ➕
- `pandas` 🐼

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📚 Example Workflow

1. **Create Embeddings**:
   - First, we generate embeddings for your documents or knowledge base using a model like **OpenAI embeddings**.

2. **Retrieve Relevant Information**:
   - Using a **retriever** like **FAISS** or **Chroma**, retrieve the most relevant documents based on the user's query.

3. **Generate Response**:
   - Pass the retrieved documents to a **generative model** to generate a response that incorporates the external knowledge.
